I have tried to copy the YouTube video instructions but as the Infura has changed the policies and I dont know how to fully use Pinata in it so the project is not working fully.

So if u want u can continue and tag me if done.

YouTube Video Name: Build Ethereum Decentralized Voting App (DOA) | Create Smart Contract, Deploy | Dapp App Project
